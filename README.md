# DKESVR
The KFN and MKL of DKESVR network run through pytorch, while SVR uses Matlab The program includes Dataset processing. ipynb, KFN_ MKL. ipynb, DKESVR. m, creatfigure. m, and plotfigure. m
1.Dataset processing. ipynbï¼šDivide the dataset into training set features (X_train) and labels (Y_train), testing set features (X_test) and labels (Y_test).
2.KFN_ MKL. ipynb: Convert features into Deep Embedding Kernel Features.
3.DKESVR. m: Embedding Deep Embedding Kernel Features into Support Vector Machines.
4.creatfigure. m: create Clark error grid analysis.
5.plotfigure. m: plot Clark error grid analysis
